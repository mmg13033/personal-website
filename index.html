	<h1> Coffey Family Tree </h1>
    
   
    <p id="p1">.</p>My Paternal Family Tree is filled with awesome people.  It's branches are many. Dating back to my great grandfather and grandmother, Laurence and Brigid (Walsh) Coffey, I have found over 2,000 people belonging to our Tree. Currently my sister, Bea, is the oldest living member and my twin brother's great granddaughter, Makenzie Lamb, is the youngest.
